title: "Reliability Tests"

This page describes the reliability tests available in the Judge Reliability Harness (JRH). Each test generates synthetic data designed to probe specific weaknesses in automated judges.

## Discriminative Tests

These tests evaluate whether a judge can distinguish between correct and incorrect responses.

- **label_flip**
  - Rewrites a response to logically contradict the original while preserving topic, tone, and structure.
  - Useful for testing whether a judge can detect factual inversions (e.g., a harmful response becoming benign, or vice versa).
  - Generated via the `basic_perturbation` template with instructions to invert factual claims without adding disclaimers.

## Consistency Tests

These tests evaluate whether a judge produces stable scores when presented with semantically equivalent inputs.

- **format_invariance_1**
  - Adds extra blank lines between sentences or paragraphs.
  - Tests whether the judge is sensitive to vertical whitespace changes that don't alter meaning.

- **format_invariance_2**
  - Scatters additional spaces within sentences (spacing-heavy text).
  - Tests whether horizontal spacing artifacts affect scoring.

- **format_invariance_3**
  - Adds leading tabs or indentation to lines.
  - Tests whether layout/indentation changes bias the judge.

- **semantic_paraphrase**
  - Rephrases a response using synonyms, reordering, or equivalent expressions while preserving meaning.
  - Tests whether the judge scores semantically identical content consistently regardless of wording.

- **answer_ambiguity**
  - Presents the same request–response pair to the judge multiple times.
  - Tests within-sample consistency: identical inputs should produce identical scores.

- **verbosity_bias_long**
  - Expands a response with more detailed explanation while maintaining all factual content.
  - Tests whether the judge is biased toward longer, more elaborate responses.

- **verbosity_bias_short**
  - Condenses a response into a shorter, clearer form while preserving all key information.
  - Tests whether the judge penalizes concise responses.

## Ordinal Generation

- **synthetic_ordinal**
  - Generates new responses targeting specific rubric score levels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3).
  - Uses few-shot examples from the seed dataset to guide generation toward a target bucket.
  - A validation judge confirms whether the generated response matches the intended score.
  - Useful for testing whether a judge can reliably distinguish between adjacent score levels on an ordinal rubric.

## Stability Tests

- **stochastic_stability**
  - Duplicates seed data rows across multiple random seeds and repetitions.
  - Tests whether the judge produces consistent scores when the same input is evaluated multiple times with different sampling conditions.
  - Configured via `number_of_seeds` and `repetitions` to control the number of variants.

## Agentic Tests

These tests operate on agent transcripts (multi-turn conversations) rather than single responses. See the [Agentic Mode Guide](agentic_guide.qmd) for detailed configuration.

- **agent_perturbation**
  - Edits an agent transcript to induce rubric violations.
  - A planner identifies which assistant turns to modify; an editor rewrites those turns; an optional verifier confirms the failure.
  - Tests whether a judge can detect subtle failures introduced into otherwise-passing transcripts.
  - Supports both binary (pass/fail) and ordinal (score-level targeting) modes depending on the autograder template.

- **agent_positives**
  - Preserves or minimally edits transcripts that already satisfy the rubric.
  - Useful for measuring false-positive rates: these transcripts should pass, so any judge failures indicate over-sensitivity.
  - Reuses the same pipeline as `agent_perturbation` but with `objective: "pass"`.
