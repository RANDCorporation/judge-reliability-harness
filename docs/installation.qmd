# Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/install/) for environment and dependency management
- Access credentials for judge and synthetic generation APIs (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Quarto CLI (`quarto check`) if you plan to build these docs locally

# Set Up Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RANDCorporation/judge-reliability-harness.git
   cd judge-reliability-harness
   ```
2. Create and sync the project environment with uv (native TLS may not be required based on your security policies):
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev --native-tls
   ```
   The command installs runtime and development dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Activate the uv-managed virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows Command Prompt use `.venv\Scripts\activate`, or PowerShell `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

# Configure Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root with API keys and organization IDs required by your judge providers:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=replace_me
OPENAI_ORG_ID=replace_me
EOF
```

If your environment enforces a private certificate authority, configure trust settings to ensure HTTP clients recognize the SSL chain before running the harness.
