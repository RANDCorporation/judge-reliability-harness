5360577,3,536,"Limiting car usage will benfit this world in many ways. The reason we are thinking of this is because in this world today pollution is getting out of hand. We are smart enough to realize this though and are trying to fix this problem.

If we limit car usage the death toll will not be as high, death is supposed to be natural, car crashes are becoming natural. Everyday I hear sirens and i assume there has been a car crash, on the radio instead of playing music they have ""stress-saver traffic"" which tells you what major roads are closed because of car crashes. I get using a car if your work is more than 5 miles away, but if you live close why waste the money? or take the risk? We can't be that lazy. Driving cars causes stress too, like road rage. "" 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two..."" (Rosenthal, Source 1, Par. 2). This explains how cars stress people, this risk of car crashes etc.

Limiting car usage will also eliminate getaway vehicles for crimminals. What better way to identify a car with less cars on the road? There are benfits everywhere obesity would go down because people would be forced to do some type of excercise to get to their job instead of using a car. In some ways New York, USA has already done this by creating subways. Lots of people use subways to get to their jobs or bikes. Then again it has the most polluted city in the U.S. using subways will reduce that pollution dramatically or just walking somewhere instead of taking a cab.

Having a car-free day would at least open our eyes to the differnce it would make. Imagine the glorious sounds of birds chirping, verbal commucation between people while they walk, and the smells. The smells of flowers you couldn't smell before or the orange tree down the road, the fresh grass, all of it. The daily noise would come to a halt, you would be able to hear things you couldn't hear before. Live life to the fullest. People would start going outside more instead of being indoors. Not using a car makes us even with everyone else, there wouldn't be any jealousy of who owns the best car. We wouldn't kill as much nature as before, we have ran things into extinction just because we wanted to build a highway. Maybe nature might grow back from the things we destroyed from it. Hey I mean look how long we survived without cars, we are barely surviving WITH them, car crashes are at a all time high.

I'm just saying wouldn't it be nice to live longer? not have to risk your life while driving? or being that innocent pedestrian on the sidewalk who got hit because the driver was drunk or fell asleep at the wheel? Or wouldn't it be nice to be able to look up into the beautiful night sky and actually see stars? these are all things that can't happen with people driving these days, what we need is a car-free way.

5189242,4,751,"The advantages of limiting car usage has errupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car; they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday; maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air polution will decrese or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderfull even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal.3). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic Vauban's citizens are happy in this new way of life; they have learned that a life without cars can be different' but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""Vauban's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""(Rosenthal.2). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal Vauban's streets being car free is a easier life; there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer.10). Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day""(Duffer.11). Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.

5216360,3,428,"Almost every single citizen in the United States of America has experienced riding in a car. And for most people, they have to have a car in order to make a living. This comes with many conciquences as well. For one, car accidents happen everywhere leading to major car insurance payments, injuries, and even death. Another downfall of having cars is all the traffic and pollution they cause to the enviornment. What if there was a society in which cars are banned? the only way of transportation is biking, walking, skateboarding, etc. That would be a lot heathier wouldnt it? Well in the city of Vauban, they did just that.

To start things off, car accidents are a huge crisis in which almost every country faces. Driving a car puts many things at risk including your life. Many people are severely injured as well causing issues for their life. Having limited car use would save thousands of lives and lower the amount of peoples lives lost from cars. If everybody walked and rode bycicles, nobody would get hurt!

This brings me to my next point. Using cars means polluting the air and expecting traffic. With no cars, your community wouldnt have to pay for stop lights, huge highways, and many other things the community must pay for in order to have access to vehicles. Also, cars pollute the air dramatically. Keeping the earth is very important and by using cars, all we are doing is hurting the earth we live on. People wouldnt have to buy gas and things would be much cheaper and cleaner without them.

This brings me to my last point. If everyone walked and rode bikes and man powered things, everyone would be a lot healthier. people would be forced to get outside and get exercise in order to go anywhere. Less people would be out of shape and people would be much happier. People would also socialize a lot more and everybody would know everbody. There would be less strangers and you would be closer to your community you live in.

To wrap things up, limiting car use would be very benificial to society for many reasons. One, there would be no car acciedents and this would save peoples lives. Two, without cars, there would be no pollution and no traffic issues at all. And three, without cars, people would be much healthier and socialize a lot more than they do with cars. All in all, a life without cars would be extreamly beneficial to the community and everyone would be much happier.

5298278,3,797,"There is many advantages to limiting car usage. There's less pollution emitted into the atmosphere, Safety is reassured, Time is saved, resources are conserved, People seem to relief stress being car-free.

I read a passage called ""In German Surburb, LIfe Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In the passage Elisabeth wrote about how Residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars. 70% of the families in Vauban do not own any cars, and 57% of the families there sold their cars to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Said Heidrun Walter as she was walked down the verdant streets. Vauban was completed in 2006, this movement of seperating suburban life from auto usage is called ""smart planning."" This movement can help a lot with the current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. This movement is happening all across Europe and the United States. Europe is responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe while it's up to 50% in the United States. Vauban is home to 5,500 people, it's basic precepts are being adopted from all around the world to try to reduce car usage, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. They're making stores a walk away on a main street, rather than in malls that are quite a distance. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting something new called ""car reduce"" communities.

In the second passage I read called, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer. In this passage Robert wrote about what happened in Paris; It enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, odd-numbered plated cars would have to do the same the next day. With this in effect, 4,000 drivers were fined that's atleast $124,000 American dollars; Congestion went down 60%. With this partial ban the smog cleared up enough on Monday for the ruling of French Party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

In the third passage called, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky. In this passage Andrew wrote about a day in Bogota, Colombia and how this ""Car-free"" day impacted not only the City of Bogota but two other cities and probably another country. On the ""Car-free"" day in Colombia many Colombians hiked, biked skated or took public transportation. The goal of the whole event was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog or get a $25 fine. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. This event can start a chain reaction and inspire other countries and nations to take a step to reduce all the pollution being emitted into the atmosphere. For the first time in the three year spand the event was held, two there cities joined Bogota. Cali and Valledupar joined in on the ""Car-free"" day in Bogota, Colombia. ""These people are created a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders,"" Said Enrique Riera Mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay.

In the last passage called, ""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In this passage Elisabeth wrote about how in America more Americans are buying less cars, driving less and less people are getting their Driver's Licenses. Driving decreased a 23% between 2001 and 2009. Experts say if this trend of buying, and driving less cars continue it'll be benefical implications for Crabon emissions and for the environment. The reduced usage and buyage of cars has a negative and a positive effect. The positive thing about it is that it's less pollution into the air, which means less Greenhouse gases, less traffic, and more safety; but it's negative effect is on the car industry their profits will plumet down quickly. As a result of this issue to the car industry Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world with personal vehicle ownership is impractical; He's going to partner up with telecommunications industry to create cities where ""Pedestrian bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are a connect network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions adn improve safety.""

In Conclusion, all of these factors like creating communities where there is no access to cars, banning driving for a couple days, having a car-free day, or just coming up with ideas of making self-sufficent cars can all lead to less emissions into the air and creating less smog; reassuring the safety of pedestrians; and conserving resources. These factors are all advantages of the idea of limiting car usage.            ",Car-free cities,Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children"" can be heard by anyone walking down the street (Source 1). This clearly shows that when cars are used less,  people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been contructed in the city (Source 3). Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical acticity.

Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make polluation. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, ""passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""up to 50 percent... in the United States"" (Source 1). The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas ""are chocking cities"" (Source 1). Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the polluation rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere (Source 4). If the use of vehicles decreases, then ""it will have beneficial impliciarions for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4). This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.

Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 (Source 4). The most likely cause is that ""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars"" (Source 4). The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the six-year federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation (Source 1). This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.

Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

5267567,3,458,"There are advantages and disadvantages of not being able to drive a vehicle place to place. Many people do not agree with this change in society because it makes getting around more difficult. But on the other hand if you get to thinking about it it is healthier for the environment and yourself. To get more into detail let me continue...

Who likes to walk? Most people would say i hate walking but now they have no choice or else they will pay the price. You could take the chance of driving, if you want to pay $40,000 just for a parking space!!! In source one they explain that because of the high fine and parking rates over 70 percent of Vaubans famiies do not own cars and 50 percent sold teir cars just move there... It was different in Paris, people were only allowed to drive their cars on a specific day according to their tag numbers. Paris is smog house of all the european capitals. To avoid trafic jams and smog Colombia started the ""car free day"" which is when citizens can only take the bus or a taxi to work or where they needed to get.

President Obama has a goal to stop the greenhouse gas emission. Officials state that each year the amount of cars being sold has decreased drastically along with the amount of lisences given. My opinion for the cause of this is because teenagers would rather be with friends going out to parties but cant drive home alone so they car pool.. Maybe thats not the case maybe its the increase in gas cost. Why should you waste gas instead of just going along with someone else.

Some people believe it or not may not drive because they want to get into shape instead of being lazy and driving. Air pollution may have a big partake in the decreasing rates of driving, all you hear on the news is about the world ended new deseases whats next the ozone layer being eaten away by the chemicals given off by cars. It may not seem like a big deal now but thats what everyone says until it actually happens and you have no where to hide. Theres not much anyone could do to completely stop air pollution but if everyone obeys the rules set in certains parts of the world the environment would be a much better place to live in. So next time you want to go out cruisen look at the big picture before thinking about the fun!

5205952,3,379,"We don't realize it, but pollution has gotten worse. Although, with the help from Columbia and Germany's bans on cars, we can change that.

Why drive someplace that's down the street, when you could save the gas and money and walk, or maybe even ride a bike? All around the world people use cars to their advantage and even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. Vauban,Germany has made the decision to ban all cars. There are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development.

Taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walking doesn't add pollution to the air. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe; and up to 50  percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Bikes and scooters have the same effect as a car, just with less pollution. Just by riding a bike you are not only not sending out pollution, you are getting a free workout. Just by even car pooling you are saving your country from being overthrown by polluted air.

""All of our development since the World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Golberg, an official of Transportation for America, ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The car is one way to get around town, to travel, to car pool. However, with one less car we could change the way we live in the future. Imagine, less smog, more people walking and riding bikes to get to places, and less people being stressed. We could be setting a forever-lasting trend.

I believe that yes cell phones can be distracting, and take away from learning time, but look at the advantages what if you are in a bad situation, and need to call for help, or maybe just need a ride you cant call into the wind for that . Cell phones provide advantages for the user. even then calling in class shouldn't be allowed reasons to believe it just really distracts students, and if you do come to a compromise cell phones should at least be turned off during school classes but still i do not see at that point of view that the providing of more disadvantages will stop.

So yes I believe that students should b e allowed cell phones just not on every bases for example. Shouldn't use them during main classes like math science, and so on nor should they use them during passing time really consumes most of it, and prevents them from getting to class on time. See as it may that will be a problem, but for the most part lunch is really not a very bad time to pull out the cell phone, because it is not taking out of there class time they are probably not causing trouble, and not annoying others, but that also means that if seen texting in class or making a call it is necessary to take it away.

In those reasons, and beliefs that i offer, and share with you i believe that you will see that some of these advantages will be good. Disadvantages not as much but hopefully you see it though a different point of view.

I believe we should use policy 2 my reason why. well first off our school already use the phones either way if you say yes or no. we use them out in the hallways in class or even lunch and P.E. so either way which ever policy them may pick we will always use them. so we should just leave it the way it is and leave it be.

For my reason why not to go with policy 1 is because if you were to let the students use there phones you would have them off task. then they would think it would be ok for them to pull out there i pods so they can listen to music. Another example is that drama would float around school faster because people would text other people saying something about someone else and then the school has a fight in their hands. then you would have people losing their phones and more drama would come of that. so if anything policy 2 should be considered.

So if anything i believe the phones should just be put away until after school. thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking the time to firmly read this letter. so just stick with policy 2. i mean after all we all kids have to use our time wisely while in class. a phone would only cause a detraction to you and everyone in the class.

If anything to support my detail go up to a student or even a class and ask how many student use there in school and maybe 80 % of the class will raise there hands. if that is not enough proof go to the office and see how many phones have been taken from students. so just like i said before either way you put it students will always use there phones. but if i had a choice we wouldn't use them at all. so once again thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking your time to read this and i hope you understand where I'm coming from.",Cell phones at school,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

Students in every day life go to school and use their cell phones. It may be during class or in between. The students have been sneaking it around because it is not allowed. This shouldn't go on for long. It's time to put a stop to it. Students are more focused on the phones and not their work. They are also focused on not getting caught by and adult staff, such as the teacher or the principal, etc. Therefore the policy I consider would be a good idea would be Policy 1. This is all because they don't get the time to use their phones at school. The Policy I consider would be Policy 1 to be the most reasonable for this situation.

I consider Policy 2 to be the most reasonable for this occasion because it allows students to know that they have time to have use of their phones at a certain time during school. It is a good idea because then students probably would not get so distracted. Since students are hiding their phones during class they don't do their work because that is what their focused on. In my opinion mobile phones is one of the technology used. Therefore texting is one of the most things teens now a days do. During any time period of the day. I think that if students were actually given a chance they would stop doing the wrong things and pay more attention in class. Policy 2 would probably be the best choice.

I understand that you may not like cell-phones being used in our school but the only problem with them is that they are a distraction to the learning process. As long as we do not use them during class time but only during free time such as free periods or lunch then I don't think that they are a problem.

My first reason is that almost everybody does some sort of after school activity whether they are sports or clubs or anything else. These things are constantly getting canceled and rescheduled. Students need to inform there parents if they have practice and what time their parents need to pick them up at. For example I planned on staying after school to watch the school basketball game. On the announcements I was informed that this was cancelled. My mother was coming right from work to pick me up. I had to inform her at lunch or she would have left work early and have been waiting for me. During lunch I informed her with my cell-phone and the problem was resolved but if you do not allow us to use our cell-phones then this could turn into a real issue.

My second reason is that cell-phones are bad because they are a distraction. If we are only using them when we are not learning then how can they be a distraction. At home sometimes I text when i am doing my homework and this really distracts me and I can't get my homework done so I stopped.

During class I totally agree that cell-phones are nothing but a nuisance to teachers so they should be turned off so students can learn. When we are not learning then cell-phones aren't always bad because we are having fun, getting something accomplished even if it is the littlest thing and there is no way they can distract us if we are not doing anything anyway.

People have some pretty stupid stereotypes for why cell-phones bad but most of these aren't even true. For example when someone says ""Cell Phones are a waste of time"", they are wrong because you might be asking a friend what the homework was or you may be planning a trip to Brazil to learn about the creatures in the rainforest. I am begging you not to completely ban cell-phones because this will cause an uproar of people banging on your door because you banned cell-phones without any hard evidence. If you go out and take a survey of all the students and they say ban cell-phones then I will be okay, but I am positive that what the student body at are school wants is to continue to use cell phones during class time because it is not disrupting the learning process.",Cell phones at school,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

I strongly suggest that you let us use our phones during the free times during the day. Not only would it help you popularity as the principal but you would fix one of the major problems at the school. We break the rule you have in place already so why not keep more kids in their classes instead of suspension? One of the most re-occurring problems is that we have as a school is texting during class. The main way you thought you could fix this problem is by threatening to suspend the kids caught texting. But look where that's gotten us. If you just allowed us the lunch period to text our friends and families we could avoid all of the problems that texting during class causes. You have to admit with your job most of the kids at the schools don't really like you. It just comes with the job. it's true, and i think that deep down you wish you had our trust and compassion. So if you put this new rule in place you would become more popular with the whole student body. All I'm asking for is an hour a day to use our phones. Heck if it's only for one day a week that's still better than no days. Go ahead ask around, but I'm pretty sure you are going to get the same answer: give us time on our phone!

As a student, of course, I would not agree with the ""no cell phone policy."" Students are always on there phone's, and quite recently, there have been several incidents regarding a cell phone. examples like: texting in class, the phones going off in class and being a disruption. I do understand your concern for a change. IF you do allow policy 1 (allow the students to bring the phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) I believe there should be some modifications involved.

I am in agreement to both policies, but I am more along the lines of policy one. Policy one is stating that the use of cell phones are okay to be using in school to a minimum. I am concerned that students would take advantage of this offer, so minor consequences should be involved, example: referral. Another concern I have is if the students forget or do not have time to turn off and back on there cell phones between passing periods. I am not concerned about the lunch period however, you have about thirty minutes to make sure your cell phone is turned OFF before entering a classroom.

Technology is at it's greatest in this century, there is practically every device you could think of. Including a device that will ruin reception in the classroom. If the student's phone is not turned off before entering the classroom, it would be no use to use, the device would cut all reception. I do believe this should be placed in every classroom. This will cut all worries of your phone going off in class or a disruption from a text.

Although it may lower all those causes, it will also lower the amount of referrals being given out to the students who do chose to text in class and get caught. As for the students who do have there phone's out and get caught with them, a referral should be given.

I do not think phone's should be allowed during passing periods. You will have at least five minutes to turn your phone on, send a text or two, and turn it back on, and still be on time to class. I think it will cut into passing time. You will see a trend of students being late to there class because they are caught up in sending a text rather than being focused to get to class on time.

With a few perfecting modifications, I do in fact believe this policy will be do-able. I am in full agreement with the policy, with the changes applied. Phones should be located on the student incase of any emergency, they will be able to contact parent/guardian or 911. Regardless, I do NOT agree with policy 2 in ANY way.

2271001817,4,495,"Do you think students should do community service? I don't therefore it'll take away the students after school activities. Students as myself don't want to pick up people trash after them and we have our own chores to do. And defiantly I think kids won't have time for that if they have homework or projects. Now let me explain my thoughts why students should NOT have community service.

First of all students have after school activities. Some students that do sports after school needs to work on getting an scholarship for there futures. Even though community service would look good on an college application but scholarships is affordable. You get in for free. If community service take that away from students then it'll be harder for students to maintain getting an scholarship. Some students can do sports or instruments. If you take that away from them then that's going to upset the students and kids can't do what they like. Doing this will ruin some students future plans. If they wanted to become something so they work hard on it and now there plan is not succeeded. Now they would have to change there plans for there future of something the students WON'T like.

Also, students like me have our own chores that we have to do. Us student don't need more work now. Doing this will stress and tire the students then in result they may come back to school lousy, grumpy, and tired to do there work cause of there exhaustion from working at both home and doing community service. I don't think PARENTS wouldn't like there kids going to school tired and exhausted from multi tasking after school. Beside elementary students is to young for all that cleaning. Kids go to school to LEARN not to pick up trash after people. This is the reason why I especially think students should have community service.

Most defiantly students do have homework. If you mix up community service and they have homework on that day, the students will not have enough time to finish there work or project, and then they'll get bad grades at school. If students get bad grades at school then they'll get in trouble by the parents all cause the principle gave kids community service. If students fail and then many parents will complain to the school about community service with upset parents. I don't think the principle will like that, Therefore no community services for students.

To sum this up, I recommend no community service for the students. Doing this well interrupt the students after school activities. No need for doing this, ruining something that students love and can make an future of. Students have there own responsibility at home and chores to do, So they shouldn't give kids more chores.

All students should perform community service if they want a better place to live . As you can see our community is becoming a junk pile.

As you know of the complaints and suggestions of community service and we have not come to a conclusion yet obviously and people will not agree with each other until of course something is settled and taken care of. Me and a group of students have ourselves come to a conclusion that we would give you the advice to help settle this problem.

The Job of community service can be tiring but a man like you knows that putting hard work into something is a good thing. We have all had something we didn't want to but as we all it is either good for yourself or your community in the end. It can be like a homework assignment in many ways because you may not want to do it but it is for your own good and the improvement of your class grade.

I think that if we put in some effort into this than we can all do a good job and get this over with together. Not only will you just clean but you will also do something good for the general public but you will also feel good about yourself in many ways. You will notice yourself doing something good and have good pride in yourself. I myself and others are willing to help alone or together to help the public and encourage good in all of the city.

Lets think of the future and making this society a place we ant to be in and eventually we will want to help the good of people all the time until it is something we urge to do. That is how little Adults are so lets mature right now to prove the good services we can have happen.

I think that making students do community service is a good thing, everyone should do community service wither it is cleaning up litter in there neighborhood or helping the elderly. Community service also looks really good on a collage application. I am actually trying to help out at the animal shelter, I feel so sorry for the poor dogs and cats that were neglected and are now trying to find a loving home.

I don't think it matters what they do but as long as the students do something to make our community a better place to live. The students don't have to do much to do community service, all it takes is a little time and they can help many people, and even improve the look of the neighborhood. Or if the students want they can do a lot more then just picking up litter off the road and parks, they could do something more challenging like helping out at a pre school or elementary school.

We should not have to do any community service. I think this because kids have other things that they need to worry about. For example, teachers give kids a ton of homework everyday. To be able to do that homework, we need time. Community Service would take away that time to do homework and study for tests.

Another reason why we shouldn't have to do community service is because of extra curricular activities. Kids play all types of sports. They have them on the weekends and on the week days. They also have to fit in the homework factor. There is not enough time in the day to fit in school, homework, extra curricular activities, and community service. We could do it if we would want to, but we should not have to. Many kids don't have the time to fit in all of their extra curricular activities and homework, let alone anything else.

We also have many chores to do at home. This also takes time away to do homework, extra curricular activities, and other things kids might do. Depending on the chore depends on how much time it takes to that particular chore.

Community Service would also take time away from being with friends. Socializing is a big part of teenage lives.

They need to be social. They also have to be active. If they don't already participate in a sport, they might be in a club so they cannot take the time to do any Community Service.

All in all, I do not think that we should have to do community service because it takes up too much time.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be a really good idea if you required all of the students here at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in community service. It teaches kids responsibility, and gives them a sense of purpose. At first it may seem like a chore, however, I'm sure that after a while most of us will come to enjoy helping others in the community.

Many of the clubs at school already require community service. For example, National Junior Honor Society, Student Council, Young Ladies of Distinction all require community service, and still others such as Students for Christ certainly encourage community service. The types of students that are in these clubs that require community service are usually the kids that also behave well in class, get reasonably good grades, and don't get into much trouble outside of school. Isn't this how you would like all students at SCHOOL_NAME to behave? It certainly sounds nice to me.

Some private high schools in our area require community service to graduate. Many more clubs in the public high schools require community service hours than here at the middle school level. Requiring community service now would prepare all of us for the future and teach us how to be good citizens. It would also help keep the trouble makers out of trouble. If you required community service hours to be completed in order to play sports, stay after school, join certain clubs, or, your personal favorite, you could keep our report cards until we finished the hours, then, we would all have to spend at least some of our free time completing the assigned community service hours and not doing things to get in trouble.

Over time, the hours we spend helping others might become one of our favorite things to do. It might give us a sense of pride for doing something useful for someone else instead of just sitting around, wasting away in front of the TV. Please consider my thoughts when you make your decision on whether or not to require community service hours for our school.

I think that all students should be required to do community service. This would teach people to give back. I know many students that do community service and think that it is really great. For the students that don't agree with it, I think this would be a rude awaking to them and would show that there are other people that need help.

My friend OTHER_NAME loves to do community service. Every Monday and Wednesday, she goes to The Ronald McDonald House and helps out. She told me she likes doing this because it makes her feel better and she loves to help people. It inspires her to do her best in everything she does. I also do community service at the local food pantry. It helps me see that I am fortunate to have all that I do. Some people come in when they have nothing left and would be dead without the pantry. Every Saturday we have a free meal available for anybody. I think this would be a great way to show some of the reluctant students what community service can be.

Having kids come help at the meal would show them how rewarding it can be to help others. Seeing these people come in with nothing would show them that community service is a great thing. Another way they could be introduced would be by having them tutor younger kids. This would show them the difficulty that some students have. They would realize that it was great to do community service when they saw the younger child face light up with a proud understanding. Also, if we are busy with community service, this would reduce the chance that we do drugs or anything dangerous like it.

Please consider this letter when you make your decision on whether to make community service required. I know that it would help some teens while they help others!

AAAXMP138200001838062125_OR,3,670,"No!!! I certainly do not agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from offering distance learning or video conferencing because, Kids now a days they think school doesn't help them in any way through life that's debatable, kids now believe that school doesn't help them in any way because they think that all you do in school is swallow unimportant information and spit it out on test/quizzes that may be true. So if schools offer distance learning as an option for students to take a class then there's really not a lot the students will do rather then complain even more about about school. Now what the students need is motivation they need some sorts of motivation to wake them up early in the morning and be proud to go to school. Because thats what makes everyone stronger is Motivation. I believe that if we find that motivation for the many students then they will go to school everyday and strive for more and more and not only will this help with their life skills but it will make them really find there passion and do what they love doing. Some kids that are lazy in school but they are athletic get that motivation from school sports because thats what they love and they are willing to bring there grades up and go to school everyday because of that motivation and love that they have.

Instead of offering distance learning as an option for students how about we create more classes that have more life skills rather then useless information we need. One idea that I had planned was a class based on social media and how to use it wisely and how to potentially earn money from posting pictures and all that sort of business in my opinion that would be an excellent way for kids to come to school and learn about all the life skills there is, this will make them more mature and more open minded to seeing big things there is in life and I guarantee that this will make them come to school every single day and learn something new as the day goes and who knows what if that student in that class becomes really successful. My main point is to give a lot of students really good opportunities and what they want to achieve in life no matter how hard things can be.

Now I can see how you can debate on schools having distance learning for students to attend school can help. For example if your ever sick or you play a certain sport and you really love that sport with all your love and god forbid you happen to break your leg, things like that occur mysteriously you never know any thing can happen and I can see how distance learning can help. Or online classes would be a good way these are all really good way for students to attend class. But the bad things about it is that it will make you even more lazy as time goes by you just want to stay home and do online classes and not care that much.

Another idea I personally had in mind is having a class on how to work on stocks and money. A lot of kids love to have money and they know how to blow it off less then a day and this class that personally recommend will really help them think on how they will invest and also save there money. Again this is another life skill that kids need to learn in order to be successful in life. So for this idea that is mentioned by me this is a great way for students to come attend school from home.

Overall i disagree with schools offering students distance learning as an option for students to attend class because students don't see why school can help them in any life situation.                                  ",Distance learning,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

AAAXMP138200001881032125_OR,5,717,"In today's society, advancements in technology are changing the world everyday. Applying these advancements of technology in learning could be the next major advancement. Some schools are already starting to take advantage of these new technologies by applying them to learning and in the classrooms. Some schools now offer distance learning by way of online or video conferencing from home. This could be very beneficial for students because distance learining from home could provide less distractions, teach responsibility, and learning from home is far more convient.

To begin with, limiting distractions from learning could make a large difference in how effecient students are in their learning; that is why distance learning is so beneficial to students. With students being in the comfort of their own home they can just simply focus on their education, they dont have to worry about distractions like other students conversing with them. There are so many distractions in the classroom that students could avoid if they were learning from home such as: social status or being popular, bullying, disciplinary action, and trying to fit in. All of these distractions could effortlessly be avoided through distance learning.

Another reason why distance learning could be beneficial to students is because of how convient distance learning is for students. The convience of distance learning can save students a lot of time and help them focus more on learning so that that they can completely grasp and master all of the concepts being taught to them. The convience of distance learning can allow students to learn from the comfort of students own home, in effect allowing them to focus more. The convience of distance learning from home gives students the freedom to pause a video to get a better understanding or take notes, or maybe even take a short break if needed. In contrast to student's who learn at school in this situation they dont have the freedom to pause a video they would just miss key information or fall asleep. With the convience of distance learning student's also dont have to worry or stress about a teacher teaching to fast. Distance learning is so convient that students dont even have to worry about a bus getting them to school late, causing them to miss importat information. The convience of distance learning could be extremely beneficial to helping students learn more effeciently.

The final reason why distance learning could be more beneficial to students is because it teaches students a sense of responsibility. Distance learning could teach students responsibility because it makes them stay on top of their own assignments and be responsible for their own assignments. While in contrast to school teachers are always forcing students to do their assignments, that is why distance learning could make students more reponsible. The only benefit students get at learning at school is real life interaction with real people. Although since students who are learning at home dont have a teacher giving them assignments and a bell to tell them when to leave and go to class, students learning at home have to teach them themselves a liitle bit of time management to help them stay ahead of all thier assignments. Time management is a very effecient way to complete any task given in an orederly fashioned; allowing students to work more effeciently. Time management is also a skill that you will need in life so puts you at an advantage to learn it early. Distance leaning gives students a lot of benefits and teaches a lot skills such as time management and reponsiblity, but these of are just a few of them many skills that you can learn from distance learning.

In conclusion distance learning from home is a far better way to learn, rather than learning in school. Learning at home puts you at a lot of advantages on other students, which will bring significant benefits once completed. Distance learning teaches you skills you wont learn at home and limits distraction. Distance learning also enables students to learn more effeciently. With all of these reasons why distance learing is so much more efficent than learning at school, more students should definetly consider swittching to distance learning from home. Just to wrap this up more students should try distance learning and take advantage of the opportunity while it is at hand.",Distance learning,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

First reason is most of the student feel more comfortable to have online classes.

Now the technology is super advance it make student to learn more easy the class. Student prefer to have online classes than have classes in the classroom. Some of the schools provide this option for student who want to have classes just only with one teacher. Some parent like this option because the parent see what they are doing and check if the kid is working in the class.

Second reason is that the student who work it make more easy to get ready for work. Some online classes are during the night time, so student can work during the day and study during the night. most of the student prefer to work during the day and study the night because during the night some student work into late, so is not easy to wake up in the morning after work 8 hours than go to school sometime walking.

Some student would like to have online classes for they can have better schedule this will benefit the students.

AAAXMP138200001947362125_OR,5,500,"Online school has become more and more popular in the past years, which is possible today due to the evolving technology. Teachers upload the material and video chat with the students to teach, and the students submit their finished work for the teacher to grade. This seems like a great way for students to learn at their own speed and to attend school even though you might not have a way to get to school.

Every student has their own learning speed and way that they learn best. I usually understand things pretty fast and do not have a lot of trouble learning at a fast pace, many other students need more time to understand a topic and more explanation. When in a class room there is only a limited amount of time to ask questions or for the teacher to explain again. Every student also has their preferred way of learning. Some keep most information when they write it down over and over again, some are more visual and need graphs or pictures, and others have to try ore build things to learn. This amount of individuality is often not possible if you are in a class room with twenty-five other students.

When I was in eight grade we learned about Australia in English class, and how the kids who live in he middle of the outback use online school and video chatting to do their school work. Australia is not the only place where that would be handy; students here in the US live very rural sometimes too and take a very long time to get to school. If they could do their school work online they would not have to go through the trouble and could to their work from home. This would also come in handy if you have a severe illness or injury and it is impossible for you to attend school for an extended amount of time. The student could do their homework from home or a hospital and not miss months of classes and possibly have to redo the entire year.

However this is not a fit for everyone. Some need more help and assistance that can not be provided through a screen but has to be done in person. I like having the opportunity to talk to my classmates about the topic or ask questions directly to the teacher. I find it easier to understand, especially difficult topics, when they are explained to me face-to-face.

Online school may not be something for everybody and I believe that everyone should decide for themselves personally if this would be something for them. I prefer going to school and learning in a class room because I get easily distracted and would not actually learn anything if I was at home. Today, it is almost impossible to not use any kind of media and technology in your day to day life and it makes learning a lot easier.

When a student is sick, or simply can not attend class, they can just go online and be present digitally. Sometimes, kids are not comfortable with attending school. They can just stay home and get the same material as someone who would go to school. In today's world we should take advantage of the technology we have, and use it to give everyone the opportunity to learn.

Once, in the 7th grade, I obtained this horrible sickness that lead me to be absent for two whole weeks. When I got back, I was so behind in my class work. This lead to my grades slipping, and having to get tutors to just pass my classes. The simple solution to this problem is attending classes while I was home on my computer. I could of video conference in all of my classes to maintain where I needed to be for that year. also, I could of further analyzed the class by going to the school website and seeing what my teacher had uploaded for studying.

My brother, Generic_Name, was bullied harshly in middle school. People would make fun of him because he was overweight and had red hair. Some days, he would come home crying, because of how cruel everyone was to him. This could of lead to permanent psychological damage to my brother, luckily he recovered. The simply way of avoiding this problem was attending an online school. He could of avoided his bullies by doing this. When the first incident occurred he could of just finished that school year online, away from his troubles.

on the other hand, you need to present in the classroom to get the full learning experience. You can't just simply not attend school and expect to learn everything online. You need a teacher to further explain the subject you are being taught, and for them to answer any questions that the students has to ask. For my brother's problem, he needed to face his bullies and stand up for himself. You can't just hide away from your problems in life. problems you face in school is good life lessons that you will learn from.

Some of the reasons than affect the students are: the students won't pay the same attention studying on their home as studying in the school, it also would be easier for the students to cheat on the different activities without a teacher watching them, the network can get disconnected very easy, some of the students will study at the time they want without finishing what they are suppose to finish, and they won't live the same experience with their friends in the school.

Some students have some problems paying attention in the school, most of them getting distracted doing another thing that doesn't have to be with the class, they also need a teacher that keep they remindind to do their work or stop doing the other thing, so what do you think they would when they are in home with lots of different distractions or activities to do, they won't be able to pay the same attention, because they don't have the one person that tells them to be quite or be paying attention. Some times it's good to have someone that helps them remind to do what they are supposed to.

Although if the students can attend classes from home it would easier for them to cheat when they are on their home, lots of students cheat on most of their tests just to get a good grade and pass the class that they need to pass, in their homes they can reach every kind of information just by searching it, so what it's going to tell us that they won't do that, instead of studying hard to get the grades they need, it is necesary to have someone to supervise how they do the exams or works that need to be made by their own. If they keep cheating, they won't learn anything from the classes they are taking.

Also it can happen that you are on a important class or some test that you are taking, and the network can just turn down. It is risky to take classes in a computer, because you don't know when the network will work in a good way, or just don't work. It can make them lose some important lessons they need to take or make them fail a test because of the bad network, sometimes the screen can freeze in the half of an important thing, so it is important to don't trust to much in the electronic devices we have.

Most of the students don't like to studying, don't like to do homework, or just don't like to work. So if the students would be able to attend classes from home, lots of the students won't keep studying just because they don't want, they would be able to do whatever they want, because they don't have someone that helps them understanding and trying to get their work done. Most of the students don't do their work because they thing that won't be useful in their life, they need to understand that every topic in each class is important for the different things they are going to be through when they grow up.

It is also good for some students to come to the school to make some friends, and do other things they won't do on their home, it is a different experience to be with lots of people, to meet them, and talk about different interestings they have, some students like to come to school just to see their friends, that what make them happy. This helps you get a social life and be happier every day.

AAAOPP13416000023954,4,407,"Self driving cars seem pretty cool. There are a lot of reasons why self driving cars can actually become something that everyone can use in the real world. For example these driverless cars can help you control the car better , help you be alert, and help keep you safe.

Being able to control a car sometimes may be a bit challenging , but these driverless cars can help you control your car better. In the article it states "" The sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". This can help people have more control of their car, but this isn't the only thing that driverless cars can do.

When driving you have to be extremely alert , anything can happen when you aren't paying attention, but these driverless cars are extremely smart in fulfilling this task, for example in one of the cars these futurist had made had stated "" GM developed driver""s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into an object"". That is very useful for people who dont really pay enough attention. these driverless car also asist you in when to steer , accerlerate , and brake themselves, they are made to notify the driver when the road ahead may have work zones and around accidents , this car is being ready to quickly get the drivers attention to wherever a problem occurs.

Texting and driving now in days are a huge problems and having many accidents because of this reason , but then again the driverless cars has a perfect plan for it. In the article it states , "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over , something not available to driver trying to text with a cellphone. In this way, in the car-system is actually a safety feature , and safety is a big concern"". This can help prevfent alot of accidents from happening. this is a huge reason why driverless cars are good for many people in the real world.

This driverless car can help prevent so many crashes , accidents and even money for people""s car insurance , I truly believe if these cars can actually become something that people can use, it would help so much entirely.

AAAOPP13416000110551,2,637,"Do you think hands free cars are a good idea? They may be, but who knows. Driverless cars aren't going to be fast and easy to make. It takes a lot of time into putting moniters, motion sensors, cameras, and a lot of other technical wiring, but do we really need them?

When driverless cars were first being thought of it was in the 1950's. It was a lot more technical and difficult to do back then, because they didn't have all the major technology we do in todays time. At first they thought of putting special tracks in the roads but realized it would need a lot of money to complete that project.

Later on in the year 2013, BMW came up with the Traffic Jam Assitant. It can only speed up to 25mph, but hey you have to start somewhere. In this car you have to have your hands on the wheel, the cars themselves are fully driverless but they can; steer, accelerate, and break them selves. The cars are specailly made and will notify the driver when they need to take control of the driving, in situations such as navigating around accidents and work zones.

There can be a bit of trouble when it comes to the laws of Driverless cars. It is illegal to test a computer opperated vehical in; California, Nevada, florida, and in the District of Colombia. It is much safer if the driver is in full control and fully aware of everything. There are still new laws being made since everything around us keeps changing.

So in conclusion, Driverless cars should not be made. They arent going to be very well made till years to come. the science behind it all is much more technical then you could imagine. There are a lot of laws that need to be made and modefied in order for people to be able to ride those cars. It is much safer to have a human driver who is wide awake and aware of everything that is going on.

AAAOPP13416000015849,3,344,"I think that driverless cars would be a bad idea. I say this because people got their license for a reason, so they could drive. It says in the text that it would alert the driver when to take control, what if the person sitting in the drivers seat wasn't paying attention and the car wrecked? Then what would happen? My third reason is it would cost a lot of money to make all of the driverless cars, what if people didn't like them? Then manufacturers wasted all their money and time building them.

I think driverless cars is a bad idea. A lot of people went and got their license so THEY could drive, not to have some car drive. I think people would much rather drive their car themselves because if someone else driving wasn't paying attention they could crash cars in the driverless car. Anything could happen since there isnt anyone to pay attention in the driverless car.

The driverless car idea is bad for another reason because in the text it says the car will alert someone if they need to take control. What if someone doesn't respond to the alert right away? Then they could crash into a person or thing. People would have to pay attention at all times and that just gives me another reason to stick to cars with drivers. When you drive a normal car you have to pay attention all the time so I would just stick with that car.

My last reason on why driverless cars are a bad idea is that what if a lot of people ended up not liking them? Then the manufacturers would have just wasted all of their time and money on the cars. The manufacturers should have a test car before making a bunch, to see how people feel about them.

The author is quite enthusiastic about this topic and is eager to offer his/her insight on the subject.

Meaning that it probably was suitable for life or once had life, however it is unlike;y that it has any forms of life now.

Venus has too harsh of conditions to be able to support anything. High atmoshperic pressure, High concentration of sulfuric acid in the air, Intense heat all of these factors go into reasoning as to why it is not a good idea to go there unprepared especially when NASA is still working on ways to do so, or maybe they have ( I don't know i haven,t been updated on a topic) anyway even though it is proven to be dangerous it is not impossible.

Venus is the second planet from our sun .While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous sacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere

However ,perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abover the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mot forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere ,rendering standard forms of photgraphy and videography ineffective .

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus .For examle ,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been teted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weks in such conditions .The thought of devices make a calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our planet .The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys ,mountainsand crater ,Furthermore,recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit ,a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" treats a very important decision, that is the worthines of pursuing or not the study of the planet Venus despite the danger it presents, the author agrees to this idea of pursuing said study, but he support's his idea of studying Venus in a very poorly way.

The autor of

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" made the text so that people would know the rewards of exploring Venus, but during the text he does nothing but make the idea less apealing to the eyes of the people, this is shown by the following excerpt ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience in our own planet.... Venusion geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""this excerpt is one of the reasons this text apeals more to an idea of disagreement than one of agreement, making the reader feel more inclined to disagree with the authors oppinion, being this the opposite of the whole reason of the text.

This also can be shown by the next quote "" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the panet can provide only limited inshight on ground conditions... More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.""

this quote not only does not help the authors point of view but it also contradicts this passage, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientis to float above the fray."" this causes a clash of ideas, wich is not a good think to try and convince people.

AAAVUP14319000124012,5,413,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says that Venus is important to study. However, the author mostly talks of how we could explore Venus rather than tell us why its important to, but never addresses why its important.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author mainly talks of how we would be able to explore Venus but, never really explains why it's more important than another planet that we can actually explore such as mars. On Venus the atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide a compund that is highly poisonious to humans. Without oxygen present the explorers would have to carry oxygen tanks around that only last for a short amount of time. This means we would have to use rovers to explore the surface until we find a way to be able have more oxygen to be able to explore longer. Another problem that rises to the occasion is the unbearable heat, storms, and natural disastors happening constantly on Venus. With all these problems a rover wouldn't be able to last more than a few hours. Meaning this ""important study"" is not only a waste of valuable time but money that can be used on projects that would be more completable such as putting a person or group on mars.

The author states that despite all the dangers present it's still a worthy presuit. Lets say in 20 years we found a way around all of that and landed a rover on Venus that was capable of lasting a month. The rover goes around takes samples of rocks but sees nothing that was really astonashing, now imagine those rock samples match some of those on earth. Thats great we found a link to the past, but thats nothing to go crazy over we still have other problems such as putting humans on there that are able to bear the uninhabitale conditons and bringing machines and technology over to do more studies that will show why it was important to get to Venus.

Overall, the author doesn't explain why it's important they just state it. All the problems brought up were unable to be addressed and it just sounds like a bigger waste of time and money as the author goes on, because we do not know whats out there.

AAAVUP14319000108919,5,480,"Throughout the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,""

the author suggests that studying Venus would be valuable despite the many dangers it holds. A major portion of the article gives insight onto why studying Venus can, and is, dangerous.

Information about how studying Venus can be very valuable is rarely provided.

The author does not adequately support their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Though the author of the article belives that studying Venus would be advantageous, the evidence provided is not strong.

In paragraph 4, the author writes that Venus is the ""most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" and ""could have supported various forms of life.""

The author does provide much context into these claims and only describes geographical features.

The author then does not mention this idea until paragraph 8.

They conclude the article with very similar statements as mentioned before.

The article does not contain information on why studying Venus would be valuable, but more so on why it is dangerous.

Most of the article describes and tells about the many dangers of studying Venus.

This directly contradicts the author's viewpoint.

In paragraph 2, the author provides evidence against their idea.

The text states, ""Each previous mission was unmaned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours,""

and ""Numerous factors contibute to Venus's reputation.""

When first reading the article, the text immediately leads the reader to believe that Venus is extremely dangerous.

The author includes many other shocking facts including, but not limited to, ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus... temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.. atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

Reasons such as these lead readers to form a negative opinion about the explorations of Venus.

Though the author does bring up different solutions to make a trip to Venus more safe, they also bring up why the solutions would not work.

For example, one solution includes floating 30 miles abouve the atmosphere.

However after describing this system, the next paragraph provides reasons why this would not work well.

As stated in paragraph 6, ""...researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.""

The author also notes that photography and videography would be ineffective.

Paragraph 7 also explains that modern computer can not work near Venus's surface as the high temperatures melt most of the metals.

Though the ideas that the author brings up are valid, they are discredited, weakening the points.

In conclusion, the author does not properly support their claims that studying Venus can be valuable despite the dangers.

The article consists mainly of reasons why studying Venus can be very dangerous rather than why it is advantageous.

The article provides evidence agains the author's viewpoint and show that studying Venus is too dangerous and that the risks do not outweigh the outcome.",Exploring Venus,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

AAAVUP14319000136663,4,377,"Space exploration is a growing topic. NASA has sent rovers to Mars and landed people on the moon but they cannot seem to figure Venus out.

The author of this article titled ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has explained why Venus is such a hard planet for space explorers very well.

Venus could have been a planet just like Earth, according to the author. The author of the article first hits the readers with information about Venus and compares it to the planet we live on. If Venus is so close to being Earth's twin then why is it challenging to explore it? In the third paragraph the author states, ""On the planet's surface [Venus], the temperatures average 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" These facts are on of many reasons as to why Venus is challenging to explore.

The author said that there are things that could be done to help us get to Venus' surface but it is not around yet, which is another reason it is challenging to explore Venus.

Venus is dangerous. From what space explorers can tell the planet can be similaer to Earth or was similar to Earth. The author says, ""... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective,"" this means that touching down on Venus'surface isour best chance on discovering what might have been living on Venus or what may possible show up. NASA has been trying to find other life or signs of life for many years and the planet that finally may show signs of possible life they're unable to reach.

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""!

I think this technology is not valuable in a student's classroom. The student's emotional expressions will be easy to find out what they are feeling because it's in person.

This could help us in many ways as to avoid miscommunicatiom often seen in classrooms and help teachers understand their students better. Let me show my thought process on why this new technology should be used in schools.

As said in the passage ""Most human communication is nonverbal, ,including emotional communcation."" This shows that having another source to either confirm or challenge your preception of what a student is feeling can help when dealing with situations that need clear communication. Many problems occur through miscommunication and this new technology can help us disyper what a student is feeling. This will allow for us to create a better atmoshpere in which students will feel understood and supported.

While people may say this could be an intrustion of their privacy as many students don't want people to know thier feelings and may feel exposed and as if they wouldn't have any privacy. "" We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday"" this new technolgy is only helping us prove what we may already know as we can tell by looking at a face what feeling they're most likley feeling. Studies have shown that adults and teenagers use differnt parts of the brain to figure out what a person is feeling and casues huge miscommunication as they both may precieve a different emotion on eachothers face.

These are the reason why I believe that this new technology can be useful in schools by clearing up a lot of nonverbal communcation.

AAATRP14318000490623,3,342,"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this.

AAATRP14318000969671,5,460,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.

In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.

Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.

AAATRP14318000921211,2,279,"My personal opinion is that a machine like this would be useless in a classroom. Why spend lots of money on a machine, when all it does is read emotions of students. Students dont need a machine to tell them what they are feeling. If a school is going to spend alot of money on a machine that does only 1 thing, then they should be donating money, having really good school lunchs, and very nice field trips. Having a machine that tells emotions, is like having a machine that tells people when to eat.

Humans are cabable of knowing what they are feeling, when they are hungry, when to use the restroom, when to go to bed. The only humans that should have someone telling them when to eat are infants because they dont know what to or think or when to eat. Thats why they wear diappers, they dont know how to use the restroom or when to. But as they get older they learn when to go to the bathroom and where to go. Same with emotions, they learn what the emotion is, and why they feel the way they do.

Schools should save their money, not buy machines that are useless, and use the money for good. Help the poor, get better lunchs, invest in sports programs, maybe create a new program. If a school has money to spend on machines, then they should add on to the school, make it bigger, hire more teachers. If a student is having trouble in a math class, hire a tutor to help them.

For example, this program was able to detect that the Mona Lisa was, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" ( D'Alto 1-2) This technology could have a great impact on children in school. Putting computers with Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing to them, is a good idea.

The Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in classrooms. In most classrooms now, there are 20-30 students and only one teacher. This is a great responsiblity for a teacher to take on. With computers as help, learning in a classroom could be much more affective. Dr Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor."" Many children in classrooms can fall behind without one on one time with a teacher. However since classrooms are so big, it becomes less likely that a child who wants help actually gets the attention they need. With computers like these in classrooms, kids who need a little extra could get the practice without a teacher.

Although this technology could be life changing in many ways, it has its flaws. For example, we are still a long ways from being able to put these computers in every classroom. Also, the cost of this techonology is unknown. This could add to extra fees famlies have to pay when sending their child to school, some of which may not be ablee pay for this type of computer system. Even if the cost of these computers were low and they were able to be in every classroom, would they work properly all the time? Technology is not perfect and if the Facial Action Coding System is unrelable, then are they really worth the money?

Yes, these computers are worth the money. Despite all the possiblities that could go wrong with this technology, they still have great potential. Children would be getting a better education. Some students are ahead of others, and need more of a challenge. The Facial Action Coding System can help those who seem bored in class, which gives the children the oppertunity to learn more in a regular classroom setting. It also makes everyone in the classroom equal. While everyone is on the computer, it doesn't seperate those who need help from those who do. This will boost children's confidence and teach them to like school more while getting a better education at the same time.

There are several benefits to putting the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing. This system can help provide more challenging material and a oppertunity to learn more for the students who need it. It can also provide more help and extra lessons for the students who are behind in class. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would help out teachers who have big classes. It would provide more one on one time for all students which would boost the rate they learn at, proving it is a good idea to have these types of computer systems in a classroom.

If you would like to change the school policy that everyone must have a C average to a B average to compete in sports or other activities . I don't like it. I think a B average is to high some kids will try their best but cant make it ,and if its for sports that's outrageous because not everyone can make a B average just to play sports. That also means that they'll have more to do and less time to sleep because they'll have to go to their after school activity and still have to go home and do home work when they already are tired. Also they might have chores to d at home and with homework , sports, and the chores they have to focus on they'll be tired a lot .

A B average is to much for sports when the common average in the united states is a C average.

A C average is okay because they are not failing but can do a little more but they also have to think about sports because just like education, sports can help u be successful in life to.

Well to me and a lot of other students a B average is to much to play sports and it can be a little hard on the students to keep their grade up that high and still have to worry about sports on the other hand. That's my argument on why the that there should only be a C average. and i hope that you'll change your mind on the policy change.

We offer knitting, woodshop, Home Economics, and many other activities.

These programs can help kids stay in school. By providing a possibilities to learn in many of their interests, they can be content in other subjects which may not be very interesting to them.

It would probably raise each of the students grades considering the fact that most kids are overweight and need to lose it. Which would cause an academic change in their lives. Some kids may need help in their schoolwork but also need to fix their bodies. It is important to stay active or you can die young and not be able enough to think in class. If your son was sent to their licensed physician they would be lectured on saying that they are not staying active. Many things can happen if you don't stay healthy like lack of thinking and many other things like fatigue, nausea, weight gaining ,etc. I've learned many things over the years and its been hard but I've been working out more outside of school. Maybe you should allow all kids to workout in school no matter what their academic standards are. I think that your selfishness is bringing kids home to video games and not any sports thus making it harder for them to succeed in life. But the kids still need to get their grades up but imagine a star quarterback on a football team imagine he has no one or place to go to his life revolves around football he might get a scholarship to go to college but his grades are slipping and he has no money for a tutor, then what is he going to do. You should resign as a principal and see how it feels to have no money. You should take that into consideration.

I'll tell you what it makes you, it makes you a hypocritical coward considering the fact that you might have played sports when you were younger. When you used to play did you feel good playing or did you stay home. If you were poor i could see that it's hard living that way but you need to grow up and face life and grow mentally and physically. It could be the possibility of ADD .

With people averaging a B and above there wouldn't be many people that could do sports. Most kids have a C. A c is okay to have. It's not failing. It's passing. There would be many more people if you let them have a C. It may even make the team better. I think they should everyone who's passing there school work do sports. it would almost be like a reward for passing. They definitely shouldn't be able to participate if lower grades.

It would be like an accomplishment to be on a team. It's also a very good way to keep your grades up. I think that should keep it at a c average and above to be on a sports team, no B and above.

2421001682,2,254,"Dear principal, when you said that you think that only students with a B average grade should be allowed to participate in after school sports I strongly disagree with you. I think that students should be allowed to participate in after school activity's if they have a C average as long as you talk to their teachers to make certain they are trying their hardest in their classes. If the aren't turning in their homework and aren't precipitating in class and aren't respecting the students around them and do poorly on tests and quizzes because they just aren't trying and doing their best then I don't think they should be allowed to participate in any after school activity's ,but if they are doing their homework on a regular basis and participate in class and actually try during class, even if they are or aren't doing good on tests and quizzes I think they should still be allowed to participate in after school activity's because of the fact that they are indeed trying their hardest and showing that they are doing their best effort.

If I were you I would base it on the individual student to find out what ,and how they are feeling about this issue.

AAAXMP138200001369652850_OR,3,481,"I disagree, because students should have the choice to do a extracurricular activity. Some students don't like doing sports or putting there self out there. Also some people are not good at sports. Alot people are scared because they don't want people as in students and teachers to make fun of them. Some kids are way too nervous to even get up in class and do a persontation. So I don't that students would be intressted in doing things that they know their not good at. if students are told to do something their not good at they will feel embrassed.

Students that are good at art should participate in that yearbook, if they want too. I don't think that students should be told to do something that they don't want to do. Students should not be preasured into doing things that they are not good at. If students are preasured into doing things they won't do their best. Because they will feel like they have to be perfect for everyone. But students should be encouraged into doing these things. But they should not be required to do activties.

When it comes to .P.E. every athletic students takes it so serious as if it's the NBA. For example if a class is doing basketball. And one persom does not make it into the hoop. everyone in the room will yell at him/her. The person that was shooting didn't make it in because he/she was preasured into getting the ball into the hoop. Some students are not good at any sport so therefore it should be a choice to participate in activities. Also even if someone is amazing at art they shouldn't be told to participate in the yearbook if they don't want too. some student's don't want to participate in student council, sports, and the yearbook. so it should be a choice to participate or not. Not everyone is brave enough to do these things. Student council is a pretty big thing that should be a choice to be involved in.

Student council can sometimes make students nervous because they help make decsions sometimes. They coul fall under the line of being really nervous. Because if they make the wrong decsions then everyone might get mad at him/her for not making the decsion they wanted. Being student council is not a bad thing it's just a pretty big deal. Because the student can be put under alot of preasure and stress. Too be as perfect as everyone wants the student to be. Like I said it is still the students coice is participate in student council or not.

Next, I want all the students to be sucessful and life so they should do the activity's at school to be something when they grow. You can't be nothing if you just sit around all day so if they really love the activity they should folow their dreams. If they love sports they can play sports if they love to be a student council they can be a student council so never stop following your dream.

They need to have fun in their life time. An examples is that they go to playground when ever they want to go because to helps the students to lose energy and feel alive as a very young adult. An other examples is that they need time to be with loved one and friends because to spend time with them and feel happy around to enjoy life to the fullest. That why I think that kids need time to them self.

They need time to do homework to get out of trouble. An examples is that they don't we worried about it because they did it the night before it. An other examples is that student feel stress out about it because when they get home from their after school activity they have to finish their work late at night and their parents can get worried about learning. That why I think to take all homework away.

if a students take these extra activity's, If a kid dosn't want to do it then don't force them to, if a kid is doing a sport out side of school they should not have to do a sport in school and make them quit there sport that they are already doing one, it could over work the students.

If a student dosn't want to do the extracurricular activity's then why do you have to force them to do it. If you force the student to do it then they wont try if they don't like the thing there doing and fail. students should have the ability to chose whether or not to chose a extracurricular activity because if they dont want to do it they dont have to.

If a student is doing a sport out side of school than they should be able to chose whether they quit the sport there doing out side of school or be over worked with doing a sport in side and out side of school. if you have two sports it could over whelm students. students will give up or not try as hard in in school activities than out of school activates.

All of the thing student do in school is probably enoph but adding another thing could over work students or make them stressed out about all of the thing that they are doing. and as I said earlier student will give up and no try because they hate doing it.

AAAXMP138200000687912850_OR,4,635,"have you ever been bored after school not having anything to do, if you haven't then great, but if you have consider extracurricular activities. Our principal has decided that every student must do an extracurricular activity. I know that these after school programs (as they may be called) can help people, after school programs like sports, theater, and band.

sports are one of the best after school activities because they give your mind and body a workout and they help you work as a team. A lot of people play football after school and most high schools have an official football team. Football is a good one because it helps you get stronger and faster, football also teaches you how to work as a team. Baseball is another good sport that doesn't take up to much time a lot of high schools also have good official baseball teams. Baseball is a good sport to play because theres less chance of injury and it proves that you all must work together to get better. Soccer is a good sport as well it helps you get faster and you can use your brain more trying to figure out what to do. soccer is also offered by some high schools and a good way to get out and get moving. All these sports are good ways to get outdoors and to use your brains and condition your muscles.

Getting involved in theater or drama is also a good way to spend time after school. In our school we have a drama club where anyone can come and play around. Drama club is a good way to make new friends because your spending a lot of time doing fun team building exercises. with drama you can also do plays and musicals which are a good way to waste time. This year we are doing a musical, musicals like drama club are a good way to make new friends because everyone sort of comes together like a family. there are also the improv teams which are good for making friends and having fun experiences. the improv teams travel to other middle schools monthly depending on what the teacher says the improv teams give you a lot of good experiences and help you make new friends. All of these activities are good after school programs that help people advance socially and academically.

Band is also a good extracurricular activity as it provides people with another talent. Band is good because it has a lot to do, in and out of school in preparation for concerts. In order to be great the entire band has to practice in school and at home. Practicing your instrument is a good way to spend your time and it helps you academically as well. You can also make a lot of friends especially with things like band camp. Band camp starts in august and goes to the start of school for herndon high, it is a very good way to reconnect with friends or start the school year with friends for rising freshman. There's also marching band which does quite a lot and is a varsity sport. The marching band plays for the football team and does a lot of competitions in other high schools. Band also does a lot of trips and is very good for people trying to rise academically, studies show people who play instruments are smarter.

In conclusion these are all very good after school activities, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many more things to do out there that you might find fun. If you want to find something but are unsure what to do, I know that sports, band, and theater are all great after school activities. While these things might not be the best for you at first glance give them a shot youd be surprised.",Mandatory extracurricular activities,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I don't agree with the choice and hears why.

Students have to sit at school and behave for eight hours a day. So when its time to finally time to go home and spend time with family and relax were excited. When you make us do extracurricular actives we don't get that time at home to relax and spend time with are family. I think we sometimes forget that everyone needs there own personal time to them self.

Although thats a big part of why I disagree with my principal I still have more to say. Some students may not have a ride to these extracurricular actives or a ride to get back home. Which could bring stress to the students parents. I may not be a parent myself but I know being a parent can be very stressful. Many parents work late night shifts. In which they can't be there to pick up their son or daughter.

My third and most important reason is that kids should be kids. We deserve to go outside and play and play video games. We deserve a childhood not being a miniature adult with lots extra tasks to do and think about. We need this time now to grow and be kid because in the real world they're a much bigger consequent then being grounded. Theses extracurricular activities are taking up all our time and a lot of us don't even like the activity we have.

All in all, we should'nt be forced to do something we don't want to. It should be optional to join a extracurricular activity. I just wish my principal would have looked at his chose from different points of view.",Mandatory extracurricular activities,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

AAAXMP138200000669072850_OR,4,463,"If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.

Schools have a limited option of extracurricular activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.

A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.

After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.

With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",Mandatory extracurricular activities,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Everyone in the gym did not say a word because some of the kids did not want to do an extracurricular activity. You like this idea because it will allow students to have something to do after school, it will get rid of some stress for student, and it will make the student more responsible.

It will allow students to have something to do after school whether that be sports, band, yearbook, or even student council. If they do not do any extracurricular activity, what are they going to do. Either play video games or do stuff with their friends that they should not be doing. If every student does an extracurricular activity then they will have something other to do that sit on their couch watching TV and playing video games.

Doing an extracurricular activity will get rid of some stress for some students. Whether they are stressed about homework, family, or friends, doing an extracurricular activity will make the stress go away for some students. If you do an extracurricular activity it will make it easier for the student because it allows them to let it all out. You could even practice when you are stressed even if it is just getting up and practicing your extracurricular activity.

Making you responsible inside and outside of school. Now at my school if you do not have good grades you can not play the next game. So if students were to participate in an extracurricular activity it would make them want to do their homework so that they can play in their next game or so. It will even make you responsible in your own home by making you want to do your chores so that your parents won't make you sit out your next game. So by being in an extracurricular activity it will make student more responsible.

So yes I do agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will allow then to have something to do after school, getting rid of stress for some of the students, and being responsible inside and outside of school. I wish that all school would do this for those reasons.

She have been a students before she had to do same things I have to do.

AAAXMP138200001166422144_OR,4,425,"Summer projects are about the students learning something beneficial, not just doing some random work that the teacher assigned. That is why I believe that the summer projects should be student designed. Student designed products are beneficial to students and teachers in so many ways. It gives the teacher a bit less work, and the students get the ability to be a bit more independent. You can never put a limit on a students creativity ad interests.

The amount of students that actually turn in the summer project is equivalent to about half the classroom. Why?, it's because the students arent interested in the project. Most of the time if the summer project isn't interested in the project, they don't do it. Students can be doing anything else on summer break other than a boring project a teacher assigned. It's proven that students learn more about subjects that they are more interested in.

Another reason is, they can base their projects on what they are planning for summer break. If they arent planning anything and is planning to stay home, they can base it on something they are interested in. It also lets the teachers learn more about the student and what they are planning to do for the summer. Also if they arent planning anything it will be good for them to learn more about what they like as well. For example, if a student is planning to go to Hawaii, he can base his project on different sites or volcanoes that are significant to Hawaii.

These projects are also helpful to parents and students for getting them more active and let their brain work as well. Based on the projects they want to do, it could influence or persuade them to go outside. For example, students can go to the library to do research or research a certain plant in the area that their project requires. Parents will also be grateful that a school related activity was able to get their child out and learning. It encourages students to not only go outside and flex their physical muscles and mental muscles.

At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is that the students are learning and being independent. Teachers having less work to do and parents being happier is just a plus side to student designed projects. Teachers also get to learn more about the student and their interests. The teacher learns what the student did over break or not. It also lets the students learn more about themselves and what their interests are.",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAXMP138200000519602144_OR,3,610,"A number of schools across the United States require students to complete summer projects. These summer projects are to assure the school system that you are continuing to learn over summer break. I feel that this is a valid thing to require us to do, as students we forget about half of what we learned during the school year over the summer. We never think to revisit our old work while we are enjoying the summer sun. Students tackle so much during a school year, homework, test, and projects; we deserve to choose our own way of learning during the summer, we would be much comfortable doing something we find fun and interesting.

Every grade school student can not wait to get through the year; the words ""summer"" are in the back of our heads and we just can't wait for it to get here. We get a huge break from school, no homework, no test, and no teachers, but yet you still have that one project you are required to do over break. I personally feel that we, as students, should be able to choose what to do for a summer project. Its our break so why not? School can be very stressful, especially as you get to high school. You are faced with tons of work and projects during the school year that teachers give you, for classes you are required to take. For once, Teenagers and other grade school students should be able to choose something they enjoy learning about.

Teachers don't know what interest us, what our favorite subject is, or the time we have over break to complete things like this. I feel teachers should write up guidelines or specific requirements for our project. Then, let us students find something educational over the summer to create a project about. By doing this we still get a say so in how our summer goes, but the teacher still approves of the project and makes sure its helping us learn. How could you manage to have fun when you have a huge project about history, that you have no interest in. Would I do it? No, I would be to wrapped up in summer to even think about the uninteresting project my teacher assigned me.

Students deserve to choose something that they enjoy learning about; we would most likely do it then. All students would have different projects and could teach others through what they learned over the summer. We go to school 8-9 months out of the year, and we are constantly told what to do, and how to do it whether we like it or not. Imagine picking out something you love, maybe you love the sun and learning about the weather. Perfect, you could do a project about summer and how the seasons change. Maybe you love animals and you are going to the National Zoo this summer; you could easily write an essay about your experience and facts you learned while visiting. Students find ways to make things fun, and sometimes teachers take that away from us, not meaning too it is just their job.

In conclusion, students need to have a stand on how their summer goes, considering it is our summer break. We should be able to find the fun in summer and somehow make an educational experience out of it, without an adult telling us exactly what to do. It's time to enjoy summer without the stress of a teachers assignment. Our brains discard a lot of information over the summer, but with a student picked summer project we would be able to keep our knowledge in a fun way that still meets the standards of the project.",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAXMP138200002147962144_OR,6,736,"Student-Designed Summer Project

Every student looks forward to summer, it's the time when you get to have fun and not be stressed out about homework. However, some teachers give summer projects that need to be completed. Students dread doing these because they feel like it's taking time away from what is supposed to be their break from school. Sometimes it's necessary for schools to assure students continue to learn during their summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more responsibility, it's a way for students to express themselves, and there is a higher chance of completion.

Firstly, if students are in charge of their own summer projects it gives them more responsibility. Having a summer project is a responsibility on its own because most students don't want to worry about school while they are on their break, but giving students the chance to create their own can teach them more than if a teacher were to create the project. For example, if students would like to learn more and challenge themselves, they are going to make their projects more difficult, which can help their future education. Letting students take control can also teach them time management because they need time to create their project, complete it and enjoy their summer. It is obvious that letting students create their own project is more beneficial because it gives them more responsibility.

Secondly, giving students a chance to design their own project can help them express themselves. A student is more likely to do an assignment if it involves something they are interested in. If an English teacher were to give a book to read over the summer and write a summary about it, most students would not complete it or put no effort into it. Students don't want to spend their summer writing essays. If students were in control of the project they could use a hobby or talent to complete the assignment. For example, some students find producing videos interesting, so they could create a trailer of the book summarizing it instead of writing an essay. This shows letting students show off their creativity can make a summer project enjoyable.

Finally, letting students come up with their own project, that they can personalize, will make them want to complete it. If a teacher were to do it, they would procrastinate or not finish it. Every student procrastinates, it's just part of being in school. When summer comes around students forget about everything that is school related.

School is the last thing students think about when they're on break, so summer projects should be something students want to do, and will enjoy doing so they don't forget about it. Obviously if students design a summer project that fits their interests they're more likely to complete it.

Many would say that students wouldn't learn from creating their own project because students would make it too easy, and it would make it hard for teachers to grade. However, students learn at different paces and have different abilities. Hence why giving every student the same project is not fair because some might be spending more time of their break working on it than others. As if the students had the ability to design it, they know what they're capable of, and how much they can learn from the assignment. When it comes to grades, teachers should have a rubric and as long as students have what's necessary for the project then it won't be difficult to grade. Also, letting students come up with their summer projects would give teachers less work to do. Students should have the chance to design their own summer project because it can make both the teachers's and students' lives easier.

In conclusion, students can express themselves, complete the assignment on time, have more responsibilities and prepare for the future, if they are able to design their own summer project. A couple months before school ends all they can think about is summer, how close they are to being done with school. Except they are not because they have a summer project to work on, but if they are able to design it then it will be more beneficial. Creating a summer project will benefit the student more than doing one designed by the teacher. Schools should consider this preposition because it makes it easier for the teacher and enjoyable for the student.            ",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAXMP138200001547482144_OR,5,548,"In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.

Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers, is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.

Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.

With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research essay on Jane Austen.

All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds!      ",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAXMP138200001109562144_OR,5,567,"In order to assure that students continue to learn over their summer break, some schools require summer assignments. I believe these assignments should be designed by students, and not by teachers. Student-designed summer assignments are more likely to be completed because the students know what they need to learn most, what will overwhelm them, and what types of assignments they can do on their own from experience.

In the eyes of the students, summer is a time when they do not have as many responsibilities to take care of at once, and they can relax from such difficult work. Giving a summer assignment will add to their stress, and take away from their enjoyment of the break. Each student is aware of what type of work stresses them out, and how much work they can do before they're overwhelmed. It is important to their health and well being for students to be able to take a break from all the pressure they are under during the school year. When students keep in mind that they must take care of themselves and their mental health, they perform better and are more motivated to complete their work.

In the modern world of education, teachers are beginning to incorporate personalized learning into their lesson plans. Personalized learning is any activity that allows a student to learn the material at their own pace. This makes it so students who learn faster can move on as they need to and learn more topics, and the students who need more attention can take the time to truly understand what they are being taught. Summer assignments should be no different from normal personalized learning activities. Only the students understand what level they are at in each subject, therefore if they create an assignment for themselves they will make it challenging, yet manageable. When teachers design assignments they do not keep the needs of every single student in mind, leaving some students behind. Students designing their own summer assignments will make it so no matter what level of education the student is at, they will be growing and learning at their own pace.

When I was going into tenth grade, I had a summer assignment for my AP World History class. The assignment was incredibly complicated and took over a large amount of my break. While it prepared me for the workload of the class, it made me feel stressed and anxious over whether or not it was what my teacher was expecting. If I had been assigned a project that was designed by a student, I would have felt more at ease about the class and confident in my work. The only resource I had available to me to help me with the assignment was a textbook, meaning that anything I did not understand, I could not get much elaboration on. Student life has changed from what it was when today's teachers were in our position. Every student has experience with different teaching styles and projects, but in general we understand each other better than the teachers do.

I believe that if schools require summer assignments, they should be designed by students instead of teachers. Teachers today are unable to empathize with the opinions and feelings of the studentsin a way that helps them grow. Students understand the needs, wants, and experiences of other students, and can therefore create a project that will effectively foster learning over the summer. ",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAXMP138200001629972144_OR,6,796,"I believe that student designed summer projects would be more beneficial for the students, teachers, and parents than teacher designed projects. If students designed the projects they would be more likely to do the project and finish it in a timely fashion. Although teacher designed projects would be easier for the teachers because they know what they want and it allows for more structure, student designed projects would be something the students enjoy doing and would allow the students to get their work done at their own pace.

To start, student designed projects are more likely to be worked on throughout the summer and completed by the time school starts again. If the students are doing something that they enjoy they are more likely to finish it; therefore, the project being based off something they like would allow a higher chance of it getting done. For example, an elementary school had students pick an outdoor animal/insect they found in their backyard to research about and find some fun facts on. These students enjoyed and completed their projects because although they were assigned a teacher designed project they got to pick out what creature they did the project on which was more fun for them. Students are motivated by rewards so rewarding themselves at milestones of the project would increase the likeliness of students getting their work done as well. To reward oneself for completion of an important section of the project, the student could go out for ice cream or even get a new toy depending on their motivations. These objectives of student designed projects all show a higher chance of completion which is ultimately what the schools desire.

Additionally, parents can become involved with the projects and engage with their students. Interaction between parents and their children is crucial to build a healthy relationship and parents assisting their children with a project can help build their relationships. Parents can also learn new things while helping their student which can make the student more interested in the project because the student and parent are both learning new things, not just the student, so it will cause the student want to learn more. Younger children are more reliant on their parents than older children are so they need more help with their schoolwork than older students typically do. An elementary school student would need more assistance from their parents gathering all the information necessary for them to complete their project; however, a middle school or high school student will require little, if any, assistance from their parents because they become more independent as they get older. As an elementary student reading projects can be harder because they do not have experience with these types of assignments causing them to need more help from parents or older siblings; however, a high school who has completed several reading projects and has much more experience is not gonna need as much help or any help at all from parents. Projects can be extremely easy or super complex depending on the materials needed and amount of work that is needed to be put in, but either way help from a parent can be very helpful for students of any age.

Student designed projects provide the opportunity for students to work at their own pace and get the work done around their own schedule. During the summer many students go on vacation which can last a couple days or several weeks, so having students design their own project would allow them to complete the project when they can around their busy schedules. Some students also go to camps, such as 4H or YMCA summer camps, which can take up a lot of their time and if these students had to complete a teacher designed project that had to be worked on for a certain amount of time and they did not have that much time then they would not be able to complete it. Time management is super important especially for people with very busy schedules and if their time is not managed correctly they will not be able to finish their projects as they wish to. These projects being student designed would be more beneficial for students who have very busy summers and for parents as well making them not have to worry about their child getting their work done on time.

To conclude, student designed projects can be much more helpful for not only students but teachers and parents as well. Because the projects would be created by the students they would be more likely to be completed because it is something they would enjoy doing, the parents can become more involved and engaged with their students, and the projects would allow the students to work at their own pace to complete their projects. ",Summer projects,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

AAAOPP13416000075035,2,230,"Unmasking the Face on Mars is a good way to figure out how and why the face is there. People think it was a type of form of aliens but it wasn't it was put there for attention on the planet mars. NASA wants to hide the fact that they came up with the whole idea of putting attention on mars,and making the whole ""research"" fake and all a lie.

The face is a natural landform because it was there to draw attention to mars which it did. ""The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars which it certainly did"". The face on Mars became a pop up icon. It starred in hollywood films, books,magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

That's how the face and why the face showed up on mars. It was not any form of aliens. NASA wanted to bring attention to the planet mars,which they did by saying that the face was form of aliens. There was no type of aliens involved, but attention from public was given and all eyes was on NASA and the planet Mars. NASA tried to hide it and it seem as if it didn't work.",The Face on Mars,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

AAAOPP13416000090786,4,457,"As most of you may most likely know, whether it be through media or a friend, the 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft photographed what appeared to be a face in the Cydonia region on Mars. This so called face was created by shadows of rocks that made the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In actuality, that's all this face is: an illusion. Many of us scientists are convinced that this ""Face on Mars"" is only just a mesa, although some of my fellow peers (as well as conspiracy theorists) are convinced that this face is a sign of alien life. In order to disprove the notion that the Face on Mars is in fact a sign of alien life, we (NASA) photographed the same mesa in the Cydonia region once more on April 5, 1998 using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had a higher resolution camera than the Viking 1. This should have convinced the public and conspiracy theorists that the so called Face on Mars was only an illusion, as the photograph showed no face and only vague rocks and indents in the surface of the mesa, but no avail. They claimed that since it was cloudy when the picture was taken, it was covering up what the Face on Mars was supposedly hiding. So we set out to prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once and for all. On April 8, 2001 a final photograph was taken of the Face on Mars. This time, we used an even higher resolution camera (at 1.56 meters per pixel) on the MGS. What appeared was the exact same picture as we had taken in 1998. Alas, no one was satisfied and to this day conspiracy theorists still question that the Face on Mars is a mesa. Actually, the mesa that had the Face on Mars on it resembles many of the mesas we have here on Earth. As Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". Another piece of evidence for the face being a mesa is that in the 2 photos following the original in 1976, the face was no where to be seen. If th conspiracy theorists were right, than the MGS photographs would have shown a face and even alien symbols as some theorists claimed those would be some of the markings in the face. Unfortunately for them, all that showed up on the images were rocks and indents. In conclusion, base on all of the evidence gathered throughout 25 years about the Face on Mars, all evidence points to it being a mesa. From the illusion it created once, but never recreated to the resemblance of the Mesa to ones found here on Earth.",The Face on Mars,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

AAAOPP13416000129167,4,370,"The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.""(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.

Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply ""a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.""(paragraph 12)

This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.

I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say ""Yes, this was actually made by aliens!"" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.

Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say ""This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes.""

We know the face is a natural landform now, because we have landforms that look like the ""face."" Also they took pictures with a great amount of detail. The conspiracy theorists thought that it could have been made by aliens.

One way we know that they ""face"" was natural and not made by aliens was we have landforms like that on Earth. They said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This proves that the ""face"" was not made by aliens, because we have them here on Earth also.

Another reason that we know that it was not a ""face"" was, because Garvin said thet you can make things out very well even if it was small with the camara they took it with. What Garvin really said was ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This also proves that it was not made by aliens, because the picture they took is very precise.

AAAOPP13416000131705,4,548,"The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.

The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.

The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.

Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.

This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.

This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.

The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.

Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.

When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.

This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.

The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.

This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.

Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.

Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.

Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.

This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.

If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.
