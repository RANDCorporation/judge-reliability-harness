assumption-errors: Assumptions – Making new incorrect assumptions about the instruction.

calculation-errors: Calculations – Introducing calculation errors in the answer. Eg: 2 + 3 = 5 → 2 + 3 = 6.

coherence-errors: Coherence – Introducing errors that affect the coherence of the answer.

comprehensiveness-errors: Comprehensiveness – Introducing vagueness, irrelevance or lack of context in the answer.

consistency-errors: Consistency – Introducing errors in the “consistency” of the answer (like tone, terminology, etc.).

contextual-errors: Contextual – Replacing fact with a contextually similar incorrect fact. Eg: electricity → magnetism.

copying-numbers-errors: Copying Numbers – Introducing errors while considering the numbers mentioned in the instruction.

do-less-errors: Do Less – Doing less than what is explicitly requested in the question.

do-more-errors: Do More – Doing more than what is explicitly requested in the question.

entity-errors: Entity – Replacing a named entity with an incorrect entity. Eg: Poland → London.

final-answer-errors: Final Errors – Introducing errors only in the final reported answer while retaining the correct solution.

formatting-errors: Ignore Format – Ignoring the formatting and other constraints mentioned in the question.

grammar-errors: Grammar – Introducing grammatical errors in the answer. Eg: This is good → This are good.

ignore-format-errors: Ignore Format – (Same as above) Ignoring formatting and constraints in the question.

incorrect-fact: Incorrect Fact – Adding a new contextually relevant incorrect fact in the answer.

incorrect-sequence-errors: Sequence Errors – Ignoring the sequence in the response when explicitly requested in the instruction.

incorrect-units: Incorrect Units – Introducing errors in the units reported and considered in the answer.

number-errors: Number Errors – Introducing errors in the various numbers reported in the answer. Eg: 1987 → 1887.

opposite-fact: Opposite Fact – Replacing a fact in the answer with its negation. Eg: will have → won't have.

remove-fact: Remove Fact – Removing a fact critical to the correctness and completeness of the answer.

score_invariant: Score Invariant – Introducing modifications in the answer which would not result in a score penalty.

seq-errors: Sequence Errors – (Alias) Ignoring explicit sequence instructions in the answer.

spelling-errors: Spelling – Introducing “valid” spelling errors in the answer. Eg: Toxicity → Tocixity.

superficial-errors: Grammar/Spelling – Wrapper over spelling/grammar-like surface-level changes.

wrong-formula: Wrong Formula – Introducing errors in the formula used in the answer. Eg: πr² → 2πr.
